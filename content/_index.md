Hi, welcome.  
My name is Zeki *(pronounced: /ˈzɛki/).*

I’m a Paris-based creative technologist.

I’m interested in the spaces where culture, art, technology and human emotion intersect —  
especially where things stop fitting neatly into categories.

I’m often described as a *jack of all trades*.  
I don’t see that as a lack of focus, but as a way of navigating ideas across mediums rather than being confined to one.

I help people shape their presence on the internet —  
whether that means a personal website, a web app, a landing page, or something less clearly defined —  
always with an emphasis on personality, atmosphere and intention rather than templates or trends.

Alongside that, I work across visual and sonic forms:  
design projects, brand identities, flyers, moving images, VJ work,  
and original music composed specifically for videos and visual narratives.

This space is where I document and share ongoing experiments and explorations —  
not as finished answers, but as processes in motion.

These are not well-traveled paths, and that’s precisely why I believe in sharing them:  
to encourage others to explore further, exchange ideas, and form connections along the way.

Feel free to reach out by email for commissioned work, questions,  
or simply to talk. *(We could all be pen pals.)*

Even if you don’t have a budget, don’t hesitate to get in touch.  
I care more about the energy behind an idea than its resources.  
Conversations like these are often where the interesting work begins.

**Let’s see what emerges.**
